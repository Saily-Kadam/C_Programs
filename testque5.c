/*write a program to determine the discount a customer gets at a shop. The program should take the amount (in rupees) that the customer spends and print the discount the customer will receive.
Discount rules:
- if the amount is less than 50, the discount is 0%.
- if the amount is between 50 and 100(inclusive), the discount is 10%.
- if the amount is between 101 and 200 (inclusive), the discount is 20%.
- if the amount is greater than 200, the discount is 30%.*/
